# Calculator 

Here, I am creating a calculator that is fully responsive with the help of Bootstrap framework and Javascript.



## Steps/Thought process

- First, I downloaded a background image from google.com and bootstrap CSS and JS from bootstrap.com and put them all together in separate folders.

- Then, I set the background image with some gradients to make it beautiful.

- Then, I created inputs and buttons  in a responsive container with rows and columns.

- For the button, initially, I have set it in disabled mode and changed it through javascript. That means until the user is not giving any input it will be in the disabled way as the user gives information the mode will be changed

- I have taken answer input as text because of a message that I want to display to the user if he/she tries to divide any number with 0.

So, I finished my assignment with all the objectives I gave. 

Thank you.
